message: "Awesome project! I am pondering building a Moonboard for quite a while, good to see OSB works just fine. Makes quite a difference in the budget. But…\r\n\r\nYou seem to have used the \"Original School Holds\", \"School Holds - Set A\" and \"School Holds - Set B\", but list \"only\" 546€ for the holds… Sets A and B cost about 700€ alone. Where did you get your holds so cheap? Or did you use the \"Power Grips\" for the black holds?"
