message: "Hello Eric,\r\n\r\nI am based here in the US (AZ) and am in the process of planning out a system wall for my garage.  Given my limited space I wanted to build something similar to yours; when I came across your design I said, \"That's it!!\"  \r\n\r\nI was wondering if you'd be able to provide more detailed insight into the joints you used as pivot points for the lowering/raising of the chassis?  My questions include:\r\n\r\n1. What are the dimensions of the wood you used? \r\n- It looks to me like 2x2\r\n\r\n2. How high up from the bottom of the joint did you place the holes for the axis point (where you placed the steel tube)?  \r\n- It looks to be 1-2 inches up but I can't tell from the photos\r\n\r\n3. What size washers did you use as spacers between the joints and rafter?\r\n\r\n4. Is there an ideal joint placement?  In other words, how far down the chassis did you place the pivot joints?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!  Really like your setup."
