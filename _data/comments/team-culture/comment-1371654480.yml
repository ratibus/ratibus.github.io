  Every member is responsible whether they are the leader or not. It's not about the leader's culture, it's the team culture and that is what makes all the difference.
  So when the leader leaves the culture must survive.
  As I said the culture is organic. It is not static. So the leader's leaving may change the team's culture but it's not a problem as long as the team has its own culture.
  Quote from Peopleware, chapter 19 (The black team) :
  > Over time, members of the team moved on one at a time to other things. Since the team function was important to the company, departing members were replaced immediately. This continued until finally there wasn't a single member left of the original group. But there was still a Black Team. The team survived the loss of all its original staff, and it emerged with its energy and its personality intact.
